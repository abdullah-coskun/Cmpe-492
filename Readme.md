This repository includes the supplementary material for our RE 2019 submisson titled as "Interpretable Machine Learning for RE: The Case of Requirements Classification"

- All notebooks we have used to extract feature values and analyze data as well as a reconstruction of the state-of-the-art classifier is provided in the Notebooks folder.

- All datasets are provided in the "Manually tagged datasets" folder. We have removed the requirements text from those with sensitive data.

- Data with various featuresets are provided in "Datasets with features". We cannot mention all different feature sets in the paper due to space limitations but provide them here for the curious readers.

- Plots we could not put in the paper due to space limitations are provided in "Plots" folder.
